# Git CL Conventions

These rules ensure correct usage of the Chromium-specific `git cl` tool in V8.

## Git Command Usage (git cl)
- **Always Format**: Run `git cl format` before creating a commit or uploading a CL.
- **Uploading to Gerrit**:
  - **Always use `-t` and/or `--commit-description`** for `git cl upload` instead of the deprecated `-m` flag, to avoid interactive editors.
  - **Ensure Non-Interactive Behavior**: When committing, amending, or uploading (e.g., `git cl upload`), prefix the command with `EDITOR=cat` (e.g., `EDITOR=cat git cl upload`) if there is a risk of an editor opening.
  - Provide a descriptive patch message: `git cl upload -t "Brief description of what changed"`.
  - **Initial Upload**: On the first upload of a new CL, use `git cl upload --commit-description=+` to set the description from the commit message.
  - **Subsequent Uploads**: On subsequent uploads (new patchsets), do **NOT** use `--commit-description=+` by default, as it can combine messages or overwrite the main description incorrectly.
  - **Updating Description**: If the changes in a new patchset make the existing CL description **out-of-date** or inaccurate, you **MUST** explicitly update it by passing `--commit-description="New cohesive description content"`.
  - Verify `git diff` is not empty before uploading.
- **Safeguards**:
  - Before performing any CL operations, ensure you have consulted the user regarding the isolation strategy as defined in the `v8-workflow` skill (e.g., branch vs. worktree).
  - Preserve the issue number when reusing a CL instead of running `git cl issue 0`.
  - Before uploading, run `git cl status` to verify the Issue Description matches your task.
  - Review the modified files (`git show --stat`) or run `git diff --name-only origin/main..HEAD` to ensure no unrelated files are included. If you see commits or files that are not part of your specific task, reset your branch to `origin/main` and cherry-pick only your intended commits instead of uploading.
  - **Verify alignment** of the subsystem/context in `git cl status` before proceeding, and consult the user if it seems mismatched.
  - For CLs intended to contain ONLY process/documentation changes, verify that no code files (e.g., `.cc`, `.h`, `.js`, `.py`) are modified using `git diff --name-only origin/main`.
- **Proactive Alert Handling**: Always run `git cl status` after uploading. If you identify failing checks or try jobs, proactively suggest addressing these alerts to the user.
- **Post-Upload**: Provide the `chromium-review.googlesource.com` link to the user.
- **Retrieving and Addressing Comments**:
  - Use this rule when asked about retrieving, addressing, reviewing, or fixing comments on the current CL.
  - If a CL number is specified, check first that it matches the current associated CL ID (find with `git cl issue`).
  - If there is no associated CL, ask the user whether you should associate it first with `git cl issue <cl_number>`.
  - Once associated (or if using current), fetch comments using `git cl comments`.
  - Note: If you have access to a dedicated tool for reviewing comments (e.g., a Gerrit MCP tool), prefer using that instead of `git cl comments`.

## Helpful Commands
- Use `git cl patch <CL_NUMBER>` to fetch and checkout the latest patchset of a CL.
- Use `git cl land` to land the CL after approval.
- Use `git cl desc` to view or edit the CL description.
